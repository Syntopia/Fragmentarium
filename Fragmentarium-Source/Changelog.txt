To be adressed:
- #Version 130 warnings? Should we switch?

More host defines:
#define DontClearOnChange   <- when sliders/camera changes, the backbuffer is not cleared.
#define IterationsBetweenRedraws 20  <- makes it possible to do several steps without updating screen.
#define IterationsBetweenRedraws 20  <- makes it possible to do several steps without updating screen.

21-05-12 [MHC]
Added max subframe counter
Added support for widget for changing bound textures.
Added texture and file manager.
Added option to set OpenGL refresh rate in preferences.
Fixed filename case sensitivity error when doing reverse lookup of line numbers.
when using "#define providesColor", now implement a 'vec3 baseColor(vec3)' function.
Tonemapping in buffershader.
DE-Raytracer.frag now uses a 'Blinn-Phong with Schickl term and physical normalization'. 
DE-Raytracer.frag and Soft-Raytracer now uses new '3D.frag' base class.
Progressive2D.frag now supports custom filtering (using '#define providesFiltering')
Added support for HDR textures (.hdr RGBE format).
Added 'Convolution.frag' example
Added tutorials: 'progressive2D' and 'pure3D'
Added experimental: 'testScene' and 'triplanarTexturing'
Added 'Env-DE-Raytracer.frag'

01-04-12 -- v0.9.1 release --

11-03-12 [MHC] 
Fixed error in 2D.frag, where changing aspect ratio would mess up viewport translation.
Fixed error in Progressive2DJulia.frag, where the HUD-display would sometimes not appear.
Cleaned up examples.
Added Knighty's 'hyperbolic-tesselation-3-5-3-colored-02'
The syntax for 2D systems has changed, simply call 'vec2 color(vec2)' now.

28-02-12 [MHC]
Created tutorials
Removed init() for 2D systems (need to '#define providesInit' now)
Changed OpenGL redraw timer to 2ms.

20-02-12 [MHC] 
Fixed: The 2x/4x/.. buffers are dimmed when rendering with DE-Raytracer after Soft-Raytracer
Fixed: Copying from web is sometimes weird (should strip rich text)
Autosave files now creates a directory with output files (necessary since the #BufferShader directive broke the old 'include all in one file' system).

02-01-12 [MHC]
Added some experimental shaders:
Soft-Raytracer.frag - progressive DOF using finite aperture
Progressive2D.frag, Progressive2DJulia.frag - progresive AA
			   
02-01-12 [MHC] 
Added support for specifying a custom (vertex+pixel) shader from the intermediate to screen buffer, e.g.:
	#buffershader "BufferShader.frag"
This is necessary to render acumulated buffer correctly.
All buffers and buffershaders should work correctly with preview and hires rendering.
			   
02-01-12 [MHC] 
Added support for rendering to an intermediate buffer. The following buffertypes are available:
	#buffer NONE, RGBA8, RGBA16, RGBA32F
The front buffer is swapped after each frame to the backbuffer, which can be accessed as:
	uniform sampler2D backbuffer;
The current frame can be accessed through
	uniform int backbufferCount;
NOTICE: for the buffer to swap continously, the render mode must be continous!
			   
25-12-11 [MHC] Fixed some error in the included fragments: Noise, Tetrahedron, and several of Knighty's examples were missing a 'providesInit'. Fixed specular bug in standard-raytracer.
