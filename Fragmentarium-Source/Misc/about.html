Much of the inspiration and formulas for Fragmentarium came from the community at <a href="http://www.fractalforums.com">Fractal Forums</a>, including Tom Beddard, Jan Kadlec, Iñigo Quilez, Knighty, Buddhi, Jesse, and others. The fragments should include information about their origins - please notify me, if I made any mis-attributions.
