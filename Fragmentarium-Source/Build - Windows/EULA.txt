Version 1.1.

This software is provided with NO WARRANTY.

That's right: not even if the software is loaded with viruses or crashes your hard-drive, can the author be held responsible. I would never intentionally include malware in the distribution, but I do not control the servers hosting the software, and will not make any guarantees. 

If you do not like this, do not run the software.

If you are okay with this, feel free to run the software on any number of computers and use it any way you want to.

If you do modify or redistribute this software make sure you respect the included GPL license (license.txt).

If you found that this EULA did not exactly ease your mind and you are worried about running this software, here is a few general suggestions:
(1) Run the software in a sandboxed environment. (VM-Ware Player provides excellent and free virtualization)
(2) Do not run as administrator, but as a non-privileged user.
(3) Compile the sources yourself.
(4) Check the MD5/SHA1 checksums to see if the files have been tampered with.
(5) Search Google to see if anyone has experienced problems with the software.
